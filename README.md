# QA-DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project

This library management app was built for an assignment for QA. It allows librarians to add books and update/delete them when required. It also allows users to view what books are in the library.

## Objectives

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies - including 
Databases, Python, Flask, Testing, Git, Basic Linux, and Project Management.    

<!--- Simple overview of use/purpose. -->

## Scope

* A Trello board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project - also potentially providing a record of any issues or risks faced when creating the project.
* A relational database used to store data persistently, with at least 2 tables in it. It is also required to model a relationship.
* Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture that will be used for the project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.
* A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on the Kanban Board.
* Fully designed test suites for the application being created, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. High test coverage must be provided in the backend, and consistent reports and evidence must be provided to support a TDD approach.
* A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model.

## Description

I researched and thought quite a bit about what I could base my project on. Eventually I decided to make an app related to books as I enjoy reading. I thought it could potentially be a project that I add more to over time.

## Trello Board

## Relational database

I thought about what relationships there could be between the entities involved with books, and I decided to start by modelling the author to book relationship, which is essentially one to many. These two tables satisfied the requirements for the MVP. I tested this using just Python, Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy before I added any additional functionality or tables.

## App Design

## Risk Assessment

## Version Control

I used Git for Version Control and hosted the project repository on Github. When I had an app that satisfied the MVP requirements, I committed that as a "main" branch. Then I created a "dev" branch and subsequently a "feature" branch so I could add extra functionality.

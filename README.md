# QA-DevOps-Core-Fundamental-Project

This library management app allows librarians to add books, update their status when they are checked out, and delete them when required. It allows users to see what books are in the library and whether they are available or not.

<!--- Simple overview of use/purpose. -->

## Description

I researched and thought quite a bit about what I could base my project on. Eventually I decided to make an app related to books as I enjoy reading. I thought it could potentially be a project that I add more to over time.
